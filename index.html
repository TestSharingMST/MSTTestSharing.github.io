<h1 class="yelltext">MST Test Sharing</h1>
<p class="whitetext">Welcome to the MST Test Sharing website! Our Goal is to make a website that allows all current and previous students to share tests amongst one another. Feel free to download any test or quiz you feel like. Using Ctrl + F will allow you to quickly search for the class and test years will be listed below. 
If you have a test you would like to submit for addition to the site please email us at testsharingmst@gmail.com with the subject as the class code, year and semester of test(ex. MATH 2222 2017 Fall). If you have more than one test please send them all in the same email with the name of the file as as the class code, year and semester of test as shown previously.  Also, please make sure that the file is in PDF. There is a free app that allows you to do this called CamScanner.
